# Autnomous-Shopping-Trolley

### Introduction
The “Autonomous Trolley” is a self-driving wheel cart (trolley) which moves behind a person, keeping a track of that person and detect other objects with a functionality of avoiding them.

### Purpose

Nowadays, many supermarkets offer convenience for shopping, one of which is a shopping trolley. It is used by customers inside the store to transport goods to the cashier during shopping and designed not to leave the store. One of the first shopping carts was introduced by Sylvan Goldman, owner of Standard Food Market in Oklahoma. He receives many complaints from his customers because they have difficulty in carrying groceries from his shop. Goldman tried to solve this problem and began experimenting with shopping baskets at his shop. He put the basket on a carriage with small wheels to help customers carrying groceries. To facilitate and satisfy his customers, he asked an engineer to design a modern shopping trolley and patented this invention. Since then, the shopping trolley is made en masse. To this day, we find many shapes of shopping trolleys in a modern supermarket. 

Seen yesterday as a dream, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are closer and closer to become a reality. As time goes by and in parallel to technological advances, research on AVs is bringing to light the huge impacts that they might imply for different fields. In supermarkets, a shopping trolley or a shopping cart is the necessary tools for purchasing. Traditionally, it is used by customers inside the store to transport goods to the cashier during shopping and designed not to leave the store. It is an inconvenience and laborious task for every person of different group age to move the cart and select different items from the racks and then, further moving it towards the cashier and eventually to their car parked in the parking lot.

Therefore, the purpose this product serves to the consumers is to lessen the labor work resulting in more focus on buying products causing a massive increase in grocery products as well as other household items.

### Video Demonstration 
Here is a video demonstration of my project:

### Code for the project
In the "Detection Algorithm" folder, all the codes related to this project are given. However, if you try to build this from scratch, it would be difficult as you would want to integrate the program with hardware. Since, I used raspberry-pi 2GB, I had to connect wires to the extensions so that motor-drivers can further assist them in moving the trolley (either forward/left/right)
